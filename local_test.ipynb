In this example, we choose the middle element.\\n3. **Partitioning**:\\n   - Elements less than the pivot go into the `left` list.\\n   - Elements equal to the pivot go into the `middle` list.\\n   - Elements greater than the pivot go into the `right` list.\\n4. **Recursive Sorting**: Recursively apply the Quick Sort algorithm to the `left` and `right` lists.\\n\\nThis implementation ensures that the array is divided into two parts: one part with elements less than the pivot and the other part with elements greater than the pivot. The process continues until the entire array is sorted.'"
